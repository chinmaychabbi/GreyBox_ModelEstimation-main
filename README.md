# State and Parameter Estimation for Model Predictive Control of Buildings

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on **batch estimation** techniques for estimating both states and parameters in building thermal models, which are crucial for effective Model Predictive Control (MPC). Using grey-box modeling and non-linear optimization, we explored multiple RC-network-based thermal models (1-state, 2-state, and 4-state) to evaluate how different modeling complexities impact the prediction and control of indoor environments.

This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Controls** course at **Washington State University**.
